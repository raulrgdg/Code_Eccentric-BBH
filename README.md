# Eccentric BBH
This repository contains the codes used in my Final Degree Project at USC: 'Gravitational Waves from Eccentric Black Hole Binaries'. 

In a first approach, it can be seen the Jupyter Notebook 'Draft_optimization_methods', where some optimization methods are tested and we look for tendencies in the chirp mass.

As well, we can find the script 'Fitting_factor', code designed to find the fitting factor for a population of eccentric signals with non-eccentric templates. Furthermore, the parameters (mass ratio and chirp mass) of the template which best fits each signal are computed.

Finally, in the script 'Plotting_Results', we designed a code in order to plot the results computed, looking the tendecies of the fitting factor and the behaviour of the non-eccentric template's parameters which best fit the eccentric signals.

These codes are published here in order to proporcionate a possible help to somebody who wants to research in the field.
I want to highlight the role of Thomas Dent, the supervisor of this study.
